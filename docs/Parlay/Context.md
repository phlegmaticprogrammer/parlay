Abstractions are referred to by name, such as `for-all`. How do we determine which particular abstraction is meant by this?

It seems the right kind of context is a package. Or is it a theory? Or a document?

Can contexts be nested, so that for example in context `C` there is another context `D` which has an abstraction called `a`, which is addressable thus as `C.D.a` ? Is context just another name for namespace?
