# Intro to Recursive teXt

*Recursive teXt* is what I am calling the basic file format, 
which consists of a sequence of blocks, where a block itself 
consists of sequences of lines and blocks.

A recursive text file has as its suffix `.rx`. 

Furthermore, to distinguish between different types of files, 
another suffix can be prepended to this, as in `.thy.rx`, 
which could for example be a theory file in recursive text format. 
Each such different type can be handled by a different *plugin*.
