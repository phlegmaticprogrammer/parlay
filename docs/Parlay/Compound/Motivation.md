# Motivation

I need a versatile UI library I know inside out, so that I can adapt it 
to my purposes as I see fit. It needs to have the following properties:

* Needs to be able to work within a contentEditable. In particular, 
  cursor position and selection must be supported.
* Ability to easily build new components by compounding existing ones, 
  as seen in React.
* Ability to switch between different modes, such as view-only if
  the cursor is not in/next to the component, and editable if the cursor
  is in/next to the component.
